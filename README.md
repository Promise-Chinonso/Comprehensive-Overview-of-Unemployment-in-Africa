## Comprehensive Overview of Unemployment in Africa (2021)

#### Context
One of the major challenges ravaging the African continent is the issue of unemployment amongst it's employable population. It may seem quite sad as the number of youths without jobs or valuable sources of income has hit an all time high. When compared to other continents of the world, one might be faced with answering the rhetorical question, why Aftica?

The African continent is the second most populated continent in the world with its population numbering up to 1.4billion (approximately 18% of the world population) as at 2021. 

This project takes a closer look at the unemployment situation in Africa, its trends and potential impacting factors with a direct focus on the year 2021.

#### Data Source(s)
The data used for this analysis was provided by *10alytics* for its Global Hackathon, 2023. 

The data contains global records for the unemployment rate across genders, country codes information, the expenditure on education by the government of different countries, strategies in place for youth employment, population's access to electricity and number of firms existing in each country. The data spans across tens of years. 

#### Tool(s) Used
I relied solely on Microsoft Excel for every step of this analysis. 

#### Processes
- Connection to data source
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Analysis
- Visualization and reporting
  
#### Connecting To The Various Data Sources, Data Cleaning and Transformation
Connecting to the 6 tables for this analysis was quite seamless as I leveraged the Power Query editor for connecting to the files containing these tables. 

Upon successful connection, the tables were individually profiled to get a breakdown of the value distributions and statistics. This process provided a clear view of the anomalies and inconsistencies within the data after which data cleaning and transformation followed.

For the data cleaning, the tables were renamed and given better and more descriptive headers, the null values were removed, incorrect data types were corrected, outliers in the year fields were removed. Some of the tables were filtered to display details from 2011-2021 as this is the year range under consideration. 

Merging of tables, conversion of rates to decimals etc. were some transformational processes that took place to enhance the data and ready it for effective analysis.

#### Data Model
To ensure accurate analysis, relationships were established between all 6 tables based on their common fields. The data modelling was done in Microsoft  Excel's Power Povot functionality and the relationship captured as shown below 👇

#### Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel's Pivot Table functionality
To continue the analysis within Excel, its Pivot table feature was used extensively for data aggregation and summarization.

#### Insights from Analysis

Analysis of the unemployment rate by continents shows that the situation in Africa is devastating, with the continent currently having the highest unemployment rate among its labor force.

Addressing this critical issue requires a multifaceted approach. Efforts should focus on implementing targeted employment programs, fostering skill development initiatives, and creating a conducive business environment to stimulate job growth. Collaboration between governments, private sectors, and international organizations is essential to formulate comprehensive strategies that address the root causes of unemployment and pave the way for sustainable economic development across the continent.

With a focus on the African continent, further analysis reveals the ten African countries most affected by the high unemployment rate. South Africa, a nation known for its diverse economic landscape and significant contributions to various industries, stands at the top of the list. However, the challenges extend beyond **South Africa**, encompassing countries such as **Djibouti**, **Eswatini**, and others. 

Addressing these specific regional disparities demands targeted interventions and collaborative efforts to foster sustainable solutions for employment and economic growth across the continent.

The significant gap in the unemployment rate between males and females in Africa, reaching as high as 4% in favor of the male population, emphasises the urgent need to minimize gender discrepancies in labor force considerations. Creating equal opportunities for everyone, irrespective of gender, is crucial for fostering a fair and inclusive job market. 

By addressing these disparities, societies can harness the full potential of their diverse talents, contributing to more balanced and thriving economies.
